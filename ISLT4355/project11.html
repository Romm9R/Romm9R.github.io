            <p>Flipnote Fight: This is an Animation done on standard unlined notecards. This project was created for an animation course during my freshman year. The animation uses more than 200 notecards to create this animation of a triangle and a square fighting. The animation runs at 12 frames per second and utilized perspective, zooms, and transitions. It was hand drawn in pencil and stitched together in adobe premiere. Reflection: I had the idea while learning about basic shapes and how things fall. We learned how objects impact the ground when falling and that gave me the idea for two objects to be fighting. Rather than hot the ground they would hit eachother. This was one of my first attempts at 2d hand drawn animation and for a first try I am pretty proud of it.

            <p>Transformation: This is an animation created using Adobe Animate. This was another project for a freshman animation course. We were tasked to create a transition between objects, for example, a square to a triangle, or it could be more complicated objects. The animation also loops, which was mandatory for the project. the animation centers around an eye appearing, disappearing, and reappearing within different circumstances. Once by itself, once on a tv, and once from the solar system. Reflection: I always liked drawing eyes, and I had made it a theme within my animations. Eyes, Tv and space are all concepts that visually speak to me so I used them all in this animation. The hardest part of this project was the tv. Getting the prespective on a rotating object is incredibly difficult when you have to drae every frame by hand. The other parts of the animation werent easy, but a large portion of the time I spent was on the TV.

            <p>Duel: Project three is a live-action fight scene filmed on a dslr camera and edited in Adobe premiere and after effects. It depicts two characters meeting and fighting each other. They each are armed with an energy sword similar to lightsabers. They have an intense dual before one of them is crowned victorious. Reflection: I enjoy watching fight scenes and I enjoy creating them. This project was rushed and the people I had filming were not too happy to be in a cold parking garage, so I wasn't able to accomplish everything I wanted to with this. One symptom is this is that the props I used for the swords broke halfway through filming and we had no replacements. Through it all though I believe this came out just fine and I am still happy with the results. I learned a lot about live action filming during this project.
