            <p>Project One: Project one is an Animation done on standard unlined notecards. This project was created for an animation course during my freshman year. The animation uses (number of cards here I don't know exactly right now) notecards to create this animation of a triangle and a square fighting. It was all done in (pencil?) and stitched together in adobe premiere. I had the idea while learning about basic shapes and how things fall. We learned how objects impact the ground when falling and that gave me the idea for two objects to be fighting. The animation runs at (12?) frames per second and utilized perspective, zooms, and transitions.

            <p>Project 2: Project two is another animation done using Adobe Animate. This was another project for a freshman animation course. We were tasked to create a transition between objects, for example, a square to a triangle, or it could be more complicated objects. I always liked drawing eyes, and I had made it a theme within my animations, so it centers around an eye appearing, disappearing, and reappearing within different circumstances. Once by itself, once on a tv, and once from the solar system. The animation also loops, which was (mandatory?) for the project. Eyes, Tv and space are all concepts that visually speak to me so I used them all in this animation.

            <p>Project Three: Project three is a live-action fight scene filmed on a (???) camera and edited in Adobe premiere and after effects. It depicts two characters meeting and fighting each other. If you can't tell, I enjoy fight scenes. They each are armed with an energy sword similar to lightsabers. They have an intense dual before one of them eventually wins. I enjoy watching fight scenes and I enjoy creating them. This project was rushed, the people I had filming were not too happy to be in a cold parking garage, so I wasn't able to accomplish everything I wanted to with this. One symptom is this is that the props I used for the swords broke halfway through filming and we had no replacements. Through it all though I believe this came out just fine.
