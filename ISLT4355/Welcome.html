     Hi, my name is Ryan, I am a sophomore and I'm majoring in digital storytelling. I'm in the animation track and I love to animate. I don't have any prior web development skills or experience, so this is totally new to me. I've never coded either but I'm excited to learn. As for what I want from the course, I guess I want what's written on the tin; to web design. I don't have any concrete goals for these skills, but I do want to know how to do this in the future. I do have an actual interest in coding, as I may have to know some of it for future animation jobs or projects. I'd say my favorite hobby is video games I guess. Really it's just anything my friends are doing, friends are my hobby, and right now they all play video games.
