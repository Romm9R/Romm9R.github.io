    <h3>The purpose of this portfolio is to put my work on display.</h3> Not just for me, but for anyone to see. Creation is an inherently giving act. Creation never stays held to one person. I create to give to others, the same way others have created and given to me. Going through this website will show you why I create what I do and what I want to create. You will see multiple of my projects, learn about how they were made, and why I made them. You will learn the inspiration behind the visuals, and ideas that inspired me while making these works. By the end of this site, you should know me and my work, and have a concrete impression of why I am. I also hope to leave you with a deeper appreciation for the act of creation, why I care so much about it, and why you should too.
