        <h3>My Career</h3>
        <p><b>I<b> have only been creating seriously for a few years now, however, my origins go way back to middle school. I grew up in a very writing-intensive middle school, but a good chunk of it was creative writing. Stories, poems, stuff like that. We also read many books that kids actually like, like Percy Jackson. These gave me the opportunity to start early. I wrote so much in those days, and I still have some of my nearly ten years old short stories. My friends and I would write together in and after school all the time. While I don't write much anymore, I credit that school for starting me on the path I now walk. 
        </p>
        <p class="tab">High school was much different. The books we read were boring, and educational. They may be classics or well written, but everyone remembers reading boring book after boring book in high school. As an adult you can appreciate them but as a freshman ninth grader? No. My interest in reading plummeted, and I started writing less. I wrote poetry for a short time, but that stopped too. At the same time I became interested in art, film and animation. During highschool I got engrossed in all of them, however I didn't make any effort to actually get out there and do any of it. I never stopped brainstorming though. If I were to go back in time and give myself the tools, and opportunity, I know I would have created something great.
        </p>
        <p class="tab">My freshman year of college was when I really started to get into everything I wanted to. I took art classes, digital storytelling courses, and animation. I learned to draw twice as the first course I took didn't fit me well, but the second fit perfectly. The digital storytelling course let me experiment with filming for the first time. Animation gave me the tools and time to dedicate to  the hours and hours it takes to animate. For the first time in years, I was doing what I always dreamed of, though at a very low level.
        </p>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p class="tab">Come to the current year. Sophomore year. This semester I am taking another animation course, a songwriting course, a digital storytelling course, a web design course, and a game design course. I have never been more engrossed in my passions than ever before. This year I expect to create the best projects I ever have. I guarantee if you come back to this same site by the end of the year, it will look a whole lot different, and a whole lot better.
